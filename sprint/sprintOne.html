            USELESS:
            I don't know what's wrong with me. I just keep getting to these points where I'm just laying here in my bed and feeling my chest sink down through the mattress and the floor. It makes it very hard to get up. This feeling, like too large an anchor on too small a boat, appears sporadically, and I get jerked downward by it like the girl in the opening scene of Jaws. I never know when it's going to reappear, so I never know when to take a breath. Whenever it hits, I feel like I'm drowning but not in water. It isn't water that I have to tread to stay afloat. I'm surrounded by tiny particles of disappointment and failure and inadequacy that accumulate throughout the hours and days of my life, and, each time my head falls below the surface, I swallow a little bit more of the bitter memories. As always, whatever this is probably seems a lot bigger to me than it really is, but, from where I am, it's scary. It's scary because everything around me is vast, and, the more I try to shrink it in my mind, the more everything opens up and spreads out around me, over me, beneath me. I know that this is a very hard time outside of my private ocean for many people that I love, and I want to help my friends and I want to make them feel better, but I feel hollow and a bit on the useless side. How can I help them, when I keep having to focus on resurfacing from beneath the waves of little embarrassments and regret? I don't know what's wrong. I hope I will wake up tomorrow and feel light again, but I can't count on that. I'm going home and I'm going to hug my parents and watch my sister in the musical and hang out with my brothers and see my nieces and I'm going to smile. But I don't know how long that breath is going to last me. I'm just looking forward to breathing the fresh air, and I'm hoping the next time I sink beneath the water will be that much easier to handle. That's all I've got for now. Thanks for listening.
